    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a savory Italian dish made of stacked layers of wide pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel, and seasoned ground meat, typically beef or sausage. Each layer melds together to create a harmonious blend of flavors, while the melted cheese on top adds a golden, indulgent finish. It's a comforting classic that invites warmth and satisfaction with every bite.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong><em> Gather your ingredients, including lasagna noodles, tomato sauce, ground meat (such as beef or sausage), onions, garlic, herbs (like basil and oregano), ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and optionally, vegetables like spinach or mushrooms.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Meat Sauce:</strong><em> In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground meat over medium heat until browned. Add diced onions and minced garlic, cooking until softened and fragrant. Stir in the tomato sauce and herbs, then let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong><em> In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with some grated Parmesan cheese. You can also add an egg to bind the mixture together if desired. Mix until well combined.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Prep the Noodles:</strong><em> Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain them and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. This will prevent them from sticking together.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong><em> Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (usually around 375°F or 190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong><em> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly. Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown slightly.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong><em> Once out of the oven, let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve without falling apart. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</em></li>
